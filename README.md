How the Chatbot Works
Image Analysis:

The chatbot uses LLava1.3B to process images and extract key features. It identifies objects, context, and relevant details in the uploaded image.
Contextual Understanding:

The model combines the visual information with language understanding to interpret the scene. This includes recognizing objects, spatial arrangements, and possible actions or emotions present in the image.
Generating Structured Output:

The result includes:
Main Objects: A concise list of the key elements in the image.
Key Takeaway or Story: A summarized narrative or inferred context based on the identified elements.
Emotion or Atmosphere: A description of the mood or implied feeling conveyed by the image.
